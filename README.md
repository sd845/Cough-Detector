### Problem Statement
To monitor the presence of face masks and detect coughs in real time and classify individuals into varying risk categories. 

#### Built With
* Flask
* Flask-SocketIO
* Librosa
* Keras
* Tensorflow
* OpenCV
* Media Recorder API
* Bootstrap 4

##### The Web Application is deployed on Microsoft Azure, and can be accessed via 
<a href="https://pnuemosense.azurewebsites.net/" target="_blank">https://pnuemosense.azurewebsites.net/</a>

#### Troubleshooting
* In case the trigger doesn't appear at all, it is advised to open the link in the incognito mode.
* Latency: latency depends on the GPU of the system on which  you are running the web application. For best results, A high performing GPU is required.

#### Training Datasets
* [ESC-50](https://github.com/karolpiczak/ESC-50)
* [Freesound](https://freesound.org)
* [Soundsnap](https://www.soundsnap.com)

#### Pre-Processing
`Librosa` is a Python package for music and audio processing which allows us to load audio as a numpy array for analysis and manipulation. For much of the preprocessing we use Librosa’s `load` function, which converts the sampling rate to 22.05 kHz, normalizes the data so the bit-depth values range between -1 and 1 and flattens the audio channels into mono.

#### Feature Extraction
For each audio file in the dataset, we extract *Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients* or MFCCs and store it in a Pandas Dataframe along with it’s classification label. For this we use Librosa’s `mfcc` function which generates an MFCC from time series audio data. MFCCs use a quasi-logarithmic spaced frequency scale, which is similar to how the human auditory system processes sounds.

#### Model
A *Convolutional Neural Network* (CNN) model was built and trained using the datasets listed. CNNs make good classifiers and perform particularly well with image classification tasks due to their feature extraction and classification parts. We use a `Sequential` model, starting with a simple model architecture, consisting of `Conv2D` convolution layers, with the final output layer being a `Dense` layer. The output layer has n nodes `num_labels` which matches the number of possible classifications.

#### How do I deploy the app?

##### Getting Started
The following package versions must be installed to successfully deploy the model.
* matplotlib 3.1.3
* ffmpeg 3.2
* numpy 1.18.5
* Flask 1.1.2
* gevent 1.4.0
* Keras 2.3.0
* librosa 0.6.3
* numba 0.49.1
* tensorflow 2.1.0
* python 3.7.1
* flask-socketio 4.3.1
* imutils 0.5.3
* opencv-python 4.3.0.36
* six 1.12.0
* scipy 1.4.1

To run the model on your <b>local machine</b>, you can download this repository as a zip file, clone or pull it by using the command
```
$ git pull https://github.com/mitali3112/Cough-Detector.git
```
or
```
$ git clone https://github.com/mitali3112/Cough-Detector.git
```
Requirements can be installed using the command (from the command-line)
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, navigate to the project folder and execute the command
```
$ python app.py
```

to deploy the app locally.
